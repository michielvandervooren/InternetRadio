# InternetRadio
After taking the Coursera courses Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems Part 1 and 2 I wanted to apply my Android knowledge by creating this simple internet radio app. It streams the music broadcasted by radio station [De Blauwe Tegel](http://www.radiodeblauwetegel.nl), which is a hobby project of one of my neighbours. This radio station does not reflect my taste of music, but is was fun creating the app.
